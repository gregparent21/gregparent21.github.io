			<h1>About</h1>
			<p className="mt-4 text-md opacity-90">
				I'm Greg — a sophomore at Cornell University majoring
				in Computer Science with a passion for building intelligent, data-driven
				software. I combine strong technical foundations in Python, Java, and SQL
				with hands-on experience in backend engineering, financial analytics, and
				full-stack development. As Co-President of Kappa Theta Pi, Cornell’s
				professional technology fraternity, and a Financial Software Engineer in
				Cornell FinTech Club, I lead teams and develop tools that merge engineering,
				software, and finance.
			</p>
			<p className="mt-4 text-md opacity-90">
				Outside of tech, I enjoy lifting, playing piano, all things rock music
				and baking.
